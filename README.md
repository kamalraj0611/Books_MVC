# Books Management MVC Application

This repository contains a simple Books Management web application built using ASP.NET MVC. The project demonstrates how to implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, making it easy to manage a collection of books. This application is an ideal starting point for learning ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and how to structure and organize code for scalable web applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - .NET SDK to build and run the application
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) - SQL Server for database management

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kamalraj0611/Books_MVC.git
    cd Books_MVC
    ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Set up the Database**:
    - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your SQL Server instance.
    - Run the initial migrations to set up the database schema.

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

4. **Build the Application**:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Project Structure

The project follows a typical MVC structure:

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models**: Define the book entities and validation rules.
- **Views**: Razor views for displaying data to the user and collecting input.
- **Data**: Database context and data access code, handled through Entity Framework Core.

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** - Web application framework for building MVC applications
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for database operations
- **SQL Server** - Database management system
- **Bootstrap** - For styling and responsive design
